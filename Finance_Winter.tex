\section*{Chapter 2: Introduction to Financial Systems - Answers}

\textbf{1a. What is a financial system? Frame your answer both from a structural and a functional perspective.}

From a \textit{functional} perspective, financial systems perform two essential economic functions: the credit function and the monetary function. The credit function provides the mechanisms by which funds are transferred from units in surplus to units with a shortage of funds to directly or indirectly facilitate lending and borrowing. This also enables wealth holders to adjust the composition of their portfolios. The monetary function provides payment mechanisms and mechanisms for risk transfer.

From a \textit{structural} perspective, financial systems comprise financial intermediaries, securities, and financial markets.

\textbf{1b. What is the primary function of depository institutions? How does this function compare with the primary function of insurance companies?}

The primary function of depository institutions is to accept deposits (liabilities) to make loans (assets) and to buy government securities. This function is centered around providing liquidity and channeling funds from savers to borrowers.

Insurance companies, in contrast, primarily protect individuals and firms from adverse events. They acquire premiums and use them to pay compensation if specified events occur. While both channel funds, depository institutions focus on short- to medium-term lending and borrowing, emphasizing liquidity, whereas insurance companies handle long-term risks and have less emphasis on immediate liquidity.

\textbf{1c. What is a mutual fund? What are the differences between short-term and long-term mutual funds? Where do mutual funds rank in terms of asset size among all financial intermediaries in the USA?}

A mutual fund pools resources from many individuals and companies and invests these resources in diversified portfolios of bonds, stocks, and money market instruments.

Long-term funds comprise bond funds (funds that contain fixed-income debt securities), equity funds (funds that contain stock securities), and hybrid funds (funds that contain both debt and stock securities). Short-term funds are represented by money market mutual funds, funds that contain various mixes of money market securities and partially allow shareholders to write checks against the value of their holdings.

In the USA, mutual funds are the second most important financial intermediary in terms of asset size, larger than the insurance industry but smaller than the commercial banking industry.

\textbf{2a. Explain how securities firms differ from investment banks. Which categories of firms are there in this industry? In what way are they financial intermediaries?}

Investment banks assist corporations or governments in the issue of \textit{new} debt or equity securities, including origination, underwriting, and placement in primary financial markets. They also provide financial advisory services on corporate finance activities (e.g., mergers and acquisitions). Their income is primarily derived from fees charged to clients.

Securities firms assist in the \textit{trading} of \textit{existing} securities in secondary markets. They are categorized as brokers (matching buyers and sellers) and dealers (buying and selling securities from their inventory). Brokers earn commissions, while dealers profit from the bid-ask spread.

The US securities firms and investment banking industry includes national full-line firms (acting as both broker-dealers and underwriters, such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley), national full-line firms specializing in corporate finance (Goldman Sachs and Smith Barney), specialized investment bank subsidiaries of commercial banks, specialized discount brokers, specialized electronic trading securities firms (like E*trade), and regional securities firms. Both investment banks and securities firms are financial intermediaries because they channel funds, albeit indirectly, by facilitating the buying and selling of securities.

\textbf{2b. What distinguishes stocks from bonds? What are the differences with reference to the risk/return relationship?}

Debt instruments (like bonds) promise the payment of given sums to the investor. Bonds represent debt owed by the issuer to the investor, paying periodic interest (coupon payments) until maturity, when the par value is repaid.

Equity instruments (like stocks) represent claims to shares in the net income and assets of a firm and have no maturity date. Firms are not contractually obliged to pay dividends to equity holders, and debt holders must be paid before equity holders. Equity claims are riskier than debt instruments. Equity also confers ownership rights, allowing holders to benefit from increased income or asset value (capital gains) and to vote. Preferred stocks are a type of equity with a fixed dividend but usually without voting rights.

The risk/return relationship is that equity claims are riskier than debt instruments. Higher risk is associated with higher expected returns. Investors demand a higher return to compensate for the greater uncertainty associated with equity investments compared to bonds.

\textbf{2c. 'Because corporations do not actually raise any funds in secondary markets, they are less important to the economy than primary markets'. Comment.}

This statement is incorrect. While corporations initially raise funds in primary markets (selling new issues of securities), secondary markets are crucial for several reasons: they increase the liquidity of securities, making them more attractive to investors and facilitating future primary market issuances. Secondary markets also set the prices of securities, influencing the price at which firms can sell in the primary market. The efficient functioning of secondary markets is therefore essential for the efficient functioning of primary markets and overall economic activity.

\textbf{3a. With reference to examples, discuss globalization of the financial markets around the world.}

Globalization of financial markets refers to the increasing integration and interconnectedness of financial markets worldwide. Several examples illustrate this:

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Euronext: The NYSE's merger with Euronext (a pan-European exchange formed from the Amsterdam, Brussels, and Paris exchanges) demonstrates cross-border integration, creating a larger, more liquid exchange group offering diverse financial products and services. This integration is a direct response to the increasing globalization of capital markets, aiming to provide participants with increased liquidity and lower transaction costs.

London Stock Exchange: The London Stock Exchange's merger with Borsa Italiana and its significant role in the Eurobond market (bonds denominated in one currency but sold in another) showcase the global reach of financial markets, with London serving as a major hub for international bond trading.

Tokyo Stock Exchange: While a significant domestic market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange also facilitates international transactions, highlighting the global nature of financial activities.

\textbf{3b. Compare and contrast quote- and order-driven markets.}

In \textit{quote-driven dealer markets}, a dealer or market-maker is on one side of every trade. Dealers hold an inventory of securities, profiting from the bid-ask spread and speculation. The NASDAQ (prior to 1997) is an example, though it now incorporates order-driven features.

\textit{Order-driven markets} involve buyers and sellers trading directly without intermediation. Many are auction markets with formalized rules for price discovery, where buyers seek the lowest and sellers the highest prices. SETS (Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Services) of the London Stock Exchange is an example, although it has quote-driven features as well. The NYSE is also a hybrid market, with specialists acting as market-makers but also incorporating public limit orders.

\textbf{3c. Explain the purpose of money markets and give examples of the types of money markets and their users.}

Money markets are financial markets where short-term debt instruments (maturity less than one year) are traded. Their purpose is to allow firms and financial institutions to manage their short-term liquidity needs, earning interest on temporary surpluses.

Examples include the US Treasury bill market (short-term government debt), and the commercial paper market (short-term corporate debt). Users include firms (managing cash flow), financial institutions (managing liquidity), and governments (financing short-term deficits).

\section*{Chapter 8: Securities and Portfolios â€“ Risk and Return - Answers to Sample Questions}

\textbf{1a. 'The more risk-averse investors are, the more likely they are to diversify.' Is this statement true, false or uncertain? Explain your answer.}

The statement is \textbf{true}. Risk-averse investors, by definition, seek to minimize risk. Diversification reduces risk by combining assets with less than perfectly correlated returns. The lower the correlation between asset returns, the greater the risk reduction achieved through diversification. Therefore, risk-averse investors have a strong incentive to diversify.

\textbf{1b. When the number of assets included in a portfolio increases, what is the effect on the portfolio standard deviation? When the number of assets increases towards infinity, towards what value does the portfolio standard deviation converge to?}

When the number of assets in a portfolio increases, the portfolio standard deviation decreases. This is because diversification reduces firm-specific risk (diversifiable risk). As the number of assets increases towards infinity, assuming assets are not perfectly correlated, the portfolio standard deviation converges to the level of market risk (systematic risk) remaining in the portfolio.

\textbf{1c. What does the mean-standard deviation frontier look like in the presence of two risky assets (and no risk-free asset)? How does it change when there is a risk-free asset? Why does one line, the capital market line, dominate all the other possible portfolio combinations?}

With two risky assets and no risk-free asset, the mean-standard deviation frontier is a curve. The lower portion represents portfolios with lower returns for given levels of risk and is not relevant for risk-averse investors. The upper portion, the efficient frontier, shows portfolios that maximize expected return for a given standard deviation or minimize standard deviation for a given expected return.

When a risk-free asset is introduced, a range of combinations of the risk-free asset and portfolios of risky assets exist. These combinations trace out a line, the capital market line (CML). One line dominates because all points along the CML offer superior returns for a given level of risk compared to portfolios not on the CML.

\textbf{1d. Explain the tangent portfolio.}

The tangent portfolio is the portfolio of risky assets that is tangent to the capital market line. It represents the optimal portfolio of risky assets for an investor to combine with the risk-free asset to create an efficient portfolio. The specific combination of the risk-free asset and tangent portfolio will vary depending on the investor's risk preferences.

\textbf{2. An investor has two assets available named X and Y. Asset X has an expected return of 7 percent and a standard deviation of 4 percent. Asset Y has an expected return of 12 percent and a standard deviation of 6 percent.}

\textbf{2a. Assume the investor places portfolio weight Â½ on asset X, and Â½ on asset Y. Assuming that the returns to the two assets are perfectly positively correlated, calculate the expected return and the standard deviation of the portfolio.}

The expected return of the portfolio (E(Rp)) is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns of assets X and Y:

E(Rp) = (0.5 * 0.07) + (0.5 * 0.12) = 0.095 or 9.5%

With perfectly positive correlation (\(\rho = +1\)), the portfolio standard deviation (\(\sigma_p\)) is simply the weighted average of the individual standard deviations:
\[
\sigma_p = w_1 \sigma_1 + w_2 \sigma_2
\]
$\sigma_p$ = (0.5 * 0.04) + (0.5 * 0.06) = 0.05 or 5%

\textbf{2b. How would your answer change if the correlation coefficient were 0.5?}

If the correlation coefficient (\(\rho\)) were 0.5, the portfolio standard deviation would be calculated using the formula:
\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 + 2 w_1 w_2 \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \rho}
\]
$\sigma_p^2 = w_X^2 \sigma_X^2 + w_Y^2 \sigma_Y^2 + 2w_X w_Y \rho \sigma_X \sigma_Y$

Where:
$w_X$ = weight of asset X = 0.5
$w_Y$ = weight of asset Y = 0.5
$\sigma_X$ = standard deviation of asset X = 0.04
$\sigma_Y$ = standard deviation of asset Y = 0.06
\(\rho\) = correlation coefficient = 0.5
Substituting these values:

$\sigma_p^2 = (0.5)^2 (0.04)^2 + (0.5)^2 (0.06)^2 + 2(0.5)(0.5)(0.5)(0.04)(0.06)$
$\sigma_p^2 = 0.0004 + 0.0009 + 0.0006 = 0.0019$
$\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.0019} \approx 0.0436$ or 4.36%

The expected return would remain unchanged at 9.5%.

\textbf{2d. In general, what does the mean-standard deviation frontier look like when the correlation coefficient is between -1 and +1?}

When the correlation coefficient (\(\rho\)) is between \(-1\) and \(+1\), the mean-standard deviation frontier is a curve. The curvature reflects the benefits of diversification. The lower the correlation, the greater the curvature and the more effective diversification is at reducing portfolio risk. 

When \(\rho = +1\) (perfect positive correlation), the frontier is a straight line, and diversification offers no risk reduction. When \(\rho = -1\) (perfect negative correlation), the frontier is made up of two straight lines.

\chapter*{Limitations of the CAPM}

The \textbf{Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)} is a foundational tool in finance, but it has several theoretical and empirical limitations.

\section*{1. Assumptions Are Unrealistic}
CAPM relies on several simplifying assumptions that do not align with real-world conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean-Variance Criterion}: The CAPM assumes that investors care only about the mean (expected returns) and variance (risk) of their portfolios. This implies that returns are normally distributed, which is often not true in practice due to skewness and heavy tails.
    \item \textbf{Homogeneous Information}: All investors are assumed to have access to the same information and agree on expected returns, variances, and covariances. In reality, information asymmetry is common.
    \item \textbf{Frictionless Markets}: The model assumes no taxes, transaction costs, or restrictions on borrowing and short-selling. Real markets involve such frictions, which affect investor behavior and asset pricing.
\end{itemize}

\section*{2. Empirical Limitations}
While the CAPM is elegant in theory, it often fails to explain real-world observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Slope of the Security Market Line (SML) is Too Flat}:
    Empirical studies show that the actual relationship between beta and returns is flatter than CAPM predicts:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item High-beta stocks tend to \textit{underperform} CAPM predictions.
        \item Low-beta stocks tend to \textit{overperform} CAPM predictions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Value and Size Effects}:
    Empirical evidence contradicts the CAPM's predictions with the discovery of additional risk-return relationships:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Size Effect}: Small-cap stocks often outperform large-cap stocks, even after adjusting for beta.
        \item \textbf{Value Effect}: High book-to-market (value) stocks outperform low book-to-market (growth) stocks, independent of beta.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Multifactor Models Perform Better}:
    Models like the Fama-French 3-Factor Model incorporate additional systematic risk factors (size and value) and provide better explanations of cross-sectional returns compared to CAPM.

    \item \textbf{Roll's Critique}:
    Richard Roll (1977) argued that CAPM is not testable because:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The market portfolio (a key input) is unobservable and cannot include all risky assets.
        \item Proxies like stock indices may not be mean-variance efficient, making it impossible to validate or refute the CAPM.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Despite these limitations, the CAPM remains an important starting point for understanding the relationship between risk and return and has inspired more robust models like the Fama-French multifactor frameworks.
